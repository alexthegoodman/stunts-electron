# Profile System

The Stunts Electron app now has a multi-profile system that allows you to create and switch between different user profiles without passwords.

## Features

- **No Authentication Required**: Profiles are simple named identities without passwords
- **Automatic Guest Profile**: On first launch, a "Guest" profile is automatically created
- **Profile Management**: Create, switch, and delete profiles easily
- **Profile Persistence**: Selected profile is saved in localStorage
- **Profile Isolation**: Each profile has its own projects, settings, and data

## How It Works

### First Launch

1. App starts at `/profiles` route
2. A default "Guest" profile is automatically created if no profiles exist
3. The Guest profile is selected and you're redirected to `/projects`

### Creating New Profiles

1. Click on the profile avatar/name in the Projects page header
2. Or navigate to `/profiles` route
3. Click "+ New Profile" button
4. Enter a profile name
5. Click "Create"

### Switching Profiles

1. Click on the current profile avatar/name in the header
2. Select a different profile from the list
3. You'll be redirected to the Projects page with the new profile's data

### Deleting Profiles

1. Go to the Profiles page
2. Click the "Ã—" button on any profile (except if it's the only one)
3. Confirm deletion
4. The profile and all its data will be removed

## Technical Details

### Storage

- Profiles are stored in `Documents/Stunts/data.json` under the `users` array
- Selected profile ID is stored in `localStorage` as `selected-profile-id`
- Each user has: `id`, `name`, `email` (optional), `role`, `userLanguage`, timestamps

### Key Files

- **Backend**:
  - `src/main/services/storage.ts` - User CRUD operations
  - `src/main/ipc/settings.ts` - IPC handlers for profile management

- **Frontend**:
  - `src/renderer/src/components/ProfileSelector.tsx` - Main profile UI
  - `src/renderer/src/components/ProfileSwitcher.tsx` - Header profile widget
  - `src/renderer/src/stunts-pages/profiles/page.tsx` - Profile selection page
  - `src/renderer/src/lib/getCurrentUserId.ts` - Profile ID utilities

### API Methods

```typescript
// Get all profiles
await window.api.settings.getAllUsers()

// Get specific profile
await window.api.settings.getUser(userId)

// Create new profile
await window.api.settings.createUser({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' })

// Update profile
await window.api.settings.updateUser({ userId, updates: { name: 'Jane' } })

// Delete profile
await window.api.settings.deleteUser(userId)

// Get or create default profile
await window.api.settings.getCurrentUser()
```

### Utility Functions

```typescript
import { getCurrentUserId, setCurrentProfile, clearCurrentProfile } from '@/lib/getCurrentUserId'

// Get current profile ID
const userId = await getCurrentUserId()

// Switch to different profile
setCurrentProfile(userId)

// Clear profile selection (will select default on next call)
clearCurrentProfile()
```

## Use Cases

1. **Personal Projects**: Keep work and personal projects separate
2. **Testing**: Create test profiles to try features without affecting main data
3. **Multiple Users**: Share one computer with family members
4. **Client Work**: Separate profiles for different clients
5. **Learning**: Create a practice profile to experiment safely

## Limitations

- No password protection (profiles are accessible to anyone using the app)
- Cannot delete the last remaining profile
- Profile data is stored locally only
- No cloud sync between devices
