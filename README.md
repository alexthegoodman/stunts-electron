# Stunts Cross-Platform

![Stunts 10/07/25](resources/screenshot1.png 'Stunts 10/07/25')

**The motion graphics editor of the future!** A bold claim based on high-quality zooms, generative keyframes, perspective, and 3D mockups, as well as a powerful, custom-built 3D engine built on-top of both WebGPU and WebGL.

**Stunts is a motion graphics editor built for high-impact, short-form video content.** Create cinematic product demos, social media ads, app previews, and brand animations with professional visual flairâ€”fast.

## What Makes Stunts Different

- **Cinematic camera movements** - Mouse movements translate into smooth, eased keyframes with perspective effects for that signature scan-like feel
- **Specialist tool for short-form** - Optimized for 30-90 second videos where every frame needs to punch (not long-form content)
- **Custom 3D engine** - Built on WebGPU and WebGL for powerful 3D mockups and animations
- **Generative keyframes** - Intelligent animation assistance that adds craft automatically
- **Fast workflow** - Most effects are just a couple clicks with intuitive options
